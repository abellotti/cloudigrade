Celery tasks for analyzing incoming logs.

Note for developers:
If you find yourself adding a new Celery task, please be aware of how Celery
determines which queue to read and write to work on that task. By default,
Celery tasks will go to a queue named "celery". If you wish to separate a task
onto a different queue (which may make it easier to see the volume of specific
waiting tasks), please be sure to update all the relevant configurations to
use that custom queue. This includes CELERY_TASK_ROUTES in config and the
Celery worker's --queues argument (see deployment-configs.yaml in shiftigrade).
